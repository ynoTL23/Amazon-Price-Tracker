# Amazon Price Tracker
Text-based price tracker that monitors price drops of a specific Amazon product.

### Why?
I was in the market to buy some stuff but I found it hard to know if I was getting the best deal possible.

With the constant changes in prices these days, it's hard to know if you're truly getting a deal.

And no one has the time to sit on a site and refresh 24/7. So, I made a small app to constantly monitor any price drops that could help me save - as long as the app is running, of course.
